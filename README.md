# 'POS Assignment':- Presentation Of Point of Sale .

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply unzip the `POS-POC` folder and install the dependencies:

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the Node package manager.

```
npm install
```

After that, you should find out that you have
below new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

### Run the Application

We have pre configured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
ng serve
```

Now browse to the app at [`http://localhost:4200/`].

### Running Unit Tests

The POS POC app comes some pre configured with unit tests. These are written in Jasmine, which we run with the Karma test runner.

```
ng test
```
